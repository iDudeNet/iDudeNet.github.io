    Terms of Service
Welcome to RoybiVerseI!  Before using our website (https://roybiverse.com/) or (https://webtv.roybiverse.com/), software, products, mobile application(s), and services (together, the “Services”, “our Services”, or “ROYBI Services”), it is important that you carefully read the following agreement.  The website located at https://roybirobot.com/ (the “Site”) is a copyrighted work belonging to ROYBI, Inc. (“ROYBI”, “us”, “our”, and “we”).  Certain features of the Services may be subject to additional guidelines, terms, or rules, which will be posted as appropriate in connection with such features.  All such additional terms, guidelines, and rules are incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service.

These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) along with OUR privacy policy set forth the legally binding terms and conditions that govern your use of ROYBI’s services.  By using the services, you are accepting these Terms (on behalf of yourself or any entity that you represent), and you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into these Terms (on behalf of yourself or the entity that you represent).  you may not use the services or accept the Terms if you are not at least 13 years old UNLESS YOUR PARENT OR SCHOOL HAVE PROVIDED THE NECESSARY CONSENT.  If you do not agree with all of the provisions of these Terms, do not use the services.

These terms require the use of arbitration (Section 10.3) on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions, and also limit the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute.

Account Creation. In order to use certain features of ROYBI’s Services, you must register for an account (“Account”) and provide certain information about yourself as prompted by the account registration form.  You represent and warrant that: (a) all required registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information. You may delete your Account at any time, for any reason, by contacting us at hello@roybirobot.com.  We may suspend or terminate your Account in accordance with Section Account Responsibilities.

Use by Children Under 13. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that all online service providers, including ROYBI, obtain parental consent before knowingly collecting personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.  We do not knowingly collect or solicit any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, except with the appropriate consent as set out below.  Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from using the Services or creating an Account unless they are doing so with parental consent or with the consent of a teacher, school, or district who is providing such consent in compliance with COPPA.  If we learn that we have collected personal information from a person under the age of 13 that does not comply with COPPA, we will delete that information as soon as reasonably practicable.  If you believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us without the necessary consent, please contact us as soon as possible at hello@roybirobot.com.

You are solely responsible for your User Content.  You assume all risks associated with use of your User Content, including any reliance on its accuracy, completeness or usefulness by others, or any disclosure of your User Content that personally identifies you or any third party.  You hereby represent and warrant that your User Content does not violate our Acceptable Use Policy (defined in Section 3).  You may not represent or imply to others that your User Content is in any way provided, sponsored or endorsed by ROYBI.  Because you alone are responsible for your User Content, you may expose yourself to liability if, for example, your User Content violates the Acceptable Use Policy.  We are not obligated to backup any User Content, and your User Content may be deleted at any time without prior notice.  You are solely responsible for creating and maintaining your own backup copies of your User Content if you desire.

We reserve the right (but have no obligation) to review any User Content, and to investigate and/or take appropriate action against you in our sole discretion if you violate the Acceptable Use Policy or any other provision of these Terms or otherwise create liability for us or any other person. Such action may include removing or modifying your User Content, terminating your Account in accordance with Section 8, and/or reporting you to law enforcement authorities.

If you provide us with any feedback or suggestions regarding the Services (“Feedback”), you hereby assign to ROYBI all rights in such Feedback and agree that we shall have the right to use such Feedback and related information as appropriate in compliance with applicable law.  You agree that you will not submit Feedback to us containing any information or ideas that you consider to be confidential or proprietary.

Your Data. ROYBI is subject to certain laws and regulations, some of which are described below.  Please visit our Privacy Policy for more information on how we collect, use, and safeguard “Data.”
ROYBI seeks to comply with all applicable federal and state student privacy laws and regulations. We will provide access to Sensitive Information pertaining to students or children only to our employees and subcontractors who reasonably need to access the data for us to provide the Services to you.

“Sensitive Information” means, collectively, (1) personally identifiable information as defined in the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) (“FERPA”); (2) educational records, as defined in FERPA (34 C.F.R § 99.3); pupil records as defined in California Education Code section 49703.1; and covered information as defined in California Business & Professions Code section 22584 (“SOPIPA”).

Limited Contact; No Advertising. Through your use of the Services, we may contact you via email to send you information about the Services including, without limitation, about changes to these Terms or our Privacy Policy, new features, and other information helpful or appropriate to the use of the Services.  ROYBI will never contact via text message or by phone.  ROYBI contacts will never request personal information such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, or other personal information. ROYBI will never contact you to advertise to you or for other commercial purposes.

You agree to indemnify and hold ROYBI (and its officers, employees, and agents) harmless, including costs and attorneys’ fees, from any claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of (a) your use of the Services, (b) your violation of these Terms, (c) your violation of applicable laws or regulations or (d) your User Content.  We reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims.  You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of ROYBI.  We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.

Third-Party Links; Other Users
Third-Party Links. The Services may contain links to third-party websites and services (collectively, “Third-Party Links”). Such links are only visible to adult (teacher and administrator) users and not to children and not intended for advertising or marketing purposes. Such Third-Party Links are not under the control of ROYBI, and we are not responsible for any Third-Party Links.  We provide access to these Third-Party Links only as a convenience to you, and do not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third-Party Links.  You use all Third-Party Links at your own risk, and should apply a suitable level of caution and discretion in doing so. When you click on any of the Third-Party Links, the applicable third party’s terms and policies apply, including the third party’s privacy and data gathering practices.  You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such Third-Party Links.

Other Users. Each Service user is solely responsible for any and all of its own User Content.  Because we do not control User Content, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any User Content, whether provided by you or by others.  We make no guarantees regarding the accuracy, currency, suitability, or quality of any User Content.  Your interactions with other Service users are solely between you and such users.  You agree that we will not be responsible for any loss or damage incurred as the result of any such interactions.  If there is a dispute between you and any Service user, we are under no obligation to become involved.

App Stores. You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Application is dependent on the third party from whom you received the Application license, e.g., the Apple App Store or Google Play (“App Store”).  You acknowledge that this Agreement is between you and ROYBI and not with the App Store.  ROYBI, not the App Store, is solely responsible for the Services, including the Application, the content thereof, maintenance, support services, and warranty therefor, and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g., product liability, legal compliance or intellectual property infringement).  You also agree to pay all fees (if any) charged by the App Store in connection with the Services, including the Application.  You agree to comply with, and your license to use the Application is conditioned upon your compliance with, all applicable third-party terms of agreement (e.g., the App Store’s terms and policies) when using the Services, including the Application. You acknowledge that the App Store (and its subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and will have the right to enforce the terms of this Agreement.

Additional Terms for Apple App Store Sourced Applications. With respect to any Application accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store (an “App Store Sourced Application”), you will only use the App Store Sourced Application (i) on an Apple-branded product that runs the iOS (Apple’s proprietary operating system) and (ii) as permitted by the “Usage Rules” set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service.  The following applies to any App Store Sourced Application accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store:

You acknowledge and agree that (i) this Agreement is concluded between you and ROYBI only, and not Apple, and (ii) ROYBI, not Apple, is solely responsible for the App Store Sourced Application and content thereof. Your use of the App Store Sourced Application must comply with the App Store Terms of Service.
You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App Store Sourced Application.

In the event of any failure of the App Store Sourced Application to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the App Store Sourced Application to you and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App Store Sourced Application. As between ROYBI and Apple, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of ROYBI.

You and ROYBI acknowledge that, as between ROYBI and Apple, Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of the App Store Sourced Application, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App Store Sourced Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.
You and ROYBI acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of that App Store Sourced Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between ROYBI and Apple, ROYBI, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by this Agreement.

You and ROYBI acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the terms of this Agreement as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.

Without limiting any other terms of this Agreement, you must comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement when using the App Store Sourced Application.

You hereby release and forever discharge ROYBI (and our officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns) from, and hereby waive and relinquish, each and every past, present and future dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right, obligation, liability, action and cause of action of every kind and nature (including personal injuries, death, and property damage), that has arisen or arises directly or indirectly out of, or that relates directly or indirectly to, the Services (including any interactions with, or act or omission of, other Service users or any Third-Party Links & Ads).  IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU HEREBY WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542 IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, WHICH STATES: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL ROYBI (OR OUR SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, OR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR DEVICE OR COMPUTER SYSTEM, OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING THEREFROM.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, OUR LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT (FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION), WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TOTHE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH THE CLAIM AROSE OR FIFTY US DOLLARS (U.S. $50).

Term and Termination.
Termination; Effect of Termination. Subject to this Section, these Terms will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services.  We may suspend or terminate your rights to use the Services (including your Account) at any time for any reason at our sole discretion, including for any use of the Services in violation of these Terms.  Upon termination of your rights under these Terms, your Account and right to access and use the Services will terminate immediately.  You understand that any termination of your Account may involve deletion of your User Content associated with your Account from our live databases.  ROYBI will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any termination of your rights under these Terms, including for termination of your Account or deletion of your User Content.  Even after your rights under these Terms are terminated, the following provisions of these Terms will remain in effect: Sections 2 through 2.5, Section 2.7 and Sections 4 through 10.

Deletion of Sensitive Information. Upon termination of your Account, you may request that we delete any Sensitive Information from our live databases and we agree to take commercially reasonable steps to honor such request in a reasonable amount of time not to exceed sixty (60) days.  You understand and agree that we may continue to have Sensitive Information in archive files or similar databases.  You further agree that we have no obligation to delete aggregated or de-identified information.  We may retain and use aggregated and de-identified information for any purpose that is consistent with applicable federal and state laws and regulations.

Copyright Policy.
ROYBI respects the intellectual property of others and asks that users of our Services do the same.  In connection with our Services, we have adopted and implemented a policy respecting copyright law that provides for the removal of any infringing materials and for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of users of our Services who are repeat infringers of intellectual property rights, including copyrights.  If you believe that one of our users is, through the use of our Services, unlawfully infringing the copyright(s) in a work, and wish to have the allegedly infringing material removed, the following information in the form of a written notification (pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)) must be provided to our designated Copyright Agent:

your physical or electronic signature;

identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim to have been infringed;

identification of the material on our services that you claim is infringing and that you request us to remove;

sufficient information to permit us to locate such material;

your address, telephone number, and e-mail address;

a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the objectionable material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or under the law; and
a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are either the owner of the copyright that has allegedly been infringed or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

Please note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any misrepresentation of material fact (falsities) in a written notification automatically subjects the complaining party to liability for any damages, costs and attorney’s fees incurred by us in connection with the written notification and allegation of copyright infringement.

The designated Copyright Agent for ROYBI is:

Designated Agent: General Counsel

General
We do not currently charge fees for access to the Services.  However, we reserve the right to do so at any time upon thirty (30) calendar days’ notice and at such time your continued use of the Services would be contingent on the payment of any applicable fees.

These Terms are subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us (if any), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our Site.  You are responsible for providing us with your most current e-mail address.  In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice.  Any changes to these Terms will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you (if applicable) or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Site.  These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Services.  Continued use of our Services following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.
Dispute Resolution; Mandatory Arbitration. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with ROYBI and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.

Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by ROYBI that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.  Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English.  This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and us, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.

Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.  A Notice to ROYBI should be sent to: 35.  After the Notice is received, you and ROYBI may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.  If you and ROYBI do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.

Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.  If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.  The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms.  The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”) governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.  Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.  For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.  Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.  If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that we made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, ROYBI will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00.  Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.

Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.  The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
Time Limits. If you or ROYBI pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.

Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and ROYBI, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and ROYBI.

Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.  Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.  In the event any litigation should arise between you and ROYBI in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND ROYBI WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.

Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential.  The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.  This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.

Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.  Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.

Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with ROYBI.

Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or ROYBI may bring an individual action in small claims court.
